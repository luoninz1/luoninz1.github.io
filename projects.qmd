- Preprocessed the dataset (1984 samples, 84 features) including technical indicators, futures contracts, etc. through feature augmentation, conversion, null value handling, and time-series train-test split.  
- Trained four machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and four deep learning models (MLP, LSTM, 1D CNN, CNN-LSTM), with Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Implemented Recursive Feature Elimination and Time-Series Cross-Validation for feature selection.  
- Evaluated and compared models and implemented an investment simulation with these models.  

### CNN and Vision Transformer Pre-trained Models for Facial Emotion Recognition
*May 2024*

- Preprocessed the FER-2013 dataset (35,887 grayscale images, 48x48 pixels, 7 categories). Addressed class imbalance with resampling and used data augmentation (rotation, resizing).  
- Designed and optimized CNN and Vision Transformer architectures. Applied learning rate schedules, gradual unfreezing, max pooling (CNN), batch normalization, dropout, and weight decay to address under/overfitting.  
- Achieved accuracy scores of 0.62 (CNN) and 0.66 (ViT). The "happy" category had the highest accuracy (0.83). Models generalized well on images outside the dataset.  

### Market Data Analysis for Airbnb in Dublin
*April 2024*  
**Objective:** Understand user profiles and optimize the search-to-booking conversion rate.  
**Tools:** Tableau, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Preprocessed the dataset (2 tables, 43k rows, 24 columns): handled nulls/outliers, converted data types, merged tables, engineered features.  
- Visualized demographics and booking behavior using Plotly, GeoPandas, and Matplotlib.  
- Trained predictive models (including XGBoost), combined them with a voting classifier, and applied cross-validation. Achieved accuracy of 0.82 (228% higher than random guessing).  
- Suggested business strategies with higher potential ROI.  

### Analysis on Airline Dataset
*September 2023*  
**Objective:** Analyze flight data to understand passenger demographics and predict flight status.  
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Sklearn, Altair)  
- Preprocessed dataset (98k rows, 15 columns) using pandas; encoded categorical data with label encoding.  
- Visualized passenger profiles (nationality, age, etc.) using Altair.  
- Predicted flight status (“on time,” “delayed,” “canceled”) with logistic regression and random forest models.
