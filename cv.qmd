**Objective:** Building CNN and Vision Transformer networks to recognize facial emotions from scratch

- Preprocessed the FER-2013 dataset with 35,887 grayscale images (48x48 pixels) of 7 categories, addressed class imbalance by resampling, and implemented data augmentation by rotating and resizing the images
- Designed and optimized the architecture of CNN and Vision Transformer networks, optimized the learning rate, increased the number of layers and used gradual unfreezing to solve underfitting, and incorporated max pooling (for CNN), batch normalizations, dropout layers, and weight decay to overcome overfitting, achieving accuracy score of 0.62 and 0.66
- The accuracy scores of the CNN and Vision Transformer models are 0.62 and 0.66, respectively. The happy category has the highest accuracy, 0.83. The models also predict well on images outside the dataset, proving their generalization capability
